# Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Data 
During the data cleaning process, I identified that the revenue column was the only column with missing values. Given that the revenue distribution was positively skewed, with a skewness of 1.0824, I decided to replace the missing values with the median value of the column. This approach is generally robust to skewed data distributions and ensures that the imputed values do not disproportionately influence the overall distribution. 

# Customer Count by Sales Method 
To determine the number of customers for each sales approach, I corrected inconsistencies in spelling and capitalization within the sales method column. After this cleanup, I grouped the data by sales method and counted the unique customer IDs. The results are as follows: 

- **Call**: 4,962 customers 

- **Email**: 7,466 customers 

- **Email + Call**: 2,572 customers 

This distribution indicates that the Email method reached the largest number of unique customers. 

# Spread of Revenue 
I computed descriptive statistics and created visualisations to assess the overall spread of revenue by each sales method. 

# Overall Revenue Statistics: 

- **Count**: 15,000 

- **Mean**: 93.62 

- **Standard Deviation**: 45.72 

- **Min**: 32.54 

- **25th Percentile**: 53.04 

- **Median (50th Percentile)**: 89.50 

- **75th Percentile**: 106.07 

- **Max**: 238.32 

# Revenue Statistics by Sales Method: 

| Sales Method    | Count | Mean  | Std   | Min   | 25%   | 50%   | 75%   | Max    | 

|-----------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------| 

| Call            | 4962  | 49.1  | 11.5  | 32.5  | 41.6  | 49.9  | 53.0  | 89.5   | 

| Email           | 7466  | 96.6  | 11.0  | 78.8  | 88.4  | 94.3  | 104.5 | 149.0  | 

| Email + Call    | 2572  | 170.9 | 42.1  | 89.5  | 149.8 | 182.1 | 189.5 | 238.3  | 

  
These statistics reveal that the Email + Call method not only has the highest mean revenue but also the widest range and standard deviation, indicating a significant spread and variability in the revenue generated. 

# Revenue Trends Over Time by Sales Method 
To investigate the revenue trends over time for each sales method, I plotted the revenue against time (weeks) for each method. The analysis showed distinct patterns: 

- **Email + Call**: This method consistently outperformed the others, starting with significantly higher revenue in the first week and maintaining strong performance throughout the period. It showed steady growth even in weeks when other methods plateaued or declined. 

- **Email**: This method also showed strong initial performance, though not as high as Email + Call. It experienced some fluctuations but generally remained stable. 

- **Call**: This method had the lowest starting revenue and showed the least growth over time. 

# Additional Customer Insights 

I also examined other key metrics such as the number of products sold, the number of years as a customer, and the number of site visits. The descriptive statistics highlighted: 

- **Years as Customer**: All methods had a similar mean number of years, with a slight edge for the Call method. 

- **Number of Site Visits**: The Email + Call method had the highest mean number of site visits, suggesting higher customer engagement. 

Overall, the Email + Call method not only drove the highest revenue but also was associated with higher engagement metrics, making it the most effective sales strategy in this dataset. 

**Recommendations**: Based on the consistent and high revenue generated by the Email + Call method, it is recommended to focus on this approach for future sales strategies. This method's effectiveness in generating and sustaining higher revenue suggests it resonates better with customers or is more efficient in converting interactions to sales. 

### Conclusion 
The comprehensive analysis of customer data across different sales methods has revealed significant insights. The Email + Call method stands out as the most effective in generating revenue and maintaining customer engagement. Moving forward, leveraging this method could optimize sales and enhance customer satisfaction. Further exploration into the specifics of what makes this method so effective, such as the nature of communication or follow-up strategies, could provide actionable insights for refining the sales approach.
